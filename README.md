Intralism Mapping Assistant, a program with multiple tools to help with your Intralism beatmap-making needs!

Note: This program only works on Windows. If there is desire for Mac/Linux versions I will look at converting this project to [Eto.Forms](https://github.com/picoe/Eto) for a cross-platform GUI.

# How to Run
Download the newest release from the [Release Page](https://github.com/FlyingRabidUnicornPig/Intralism-Mapping-Assistant/releases). Extract to a folder, then double click `Intralism Mapping Assistant.exe` to run

Due to the nature of this project, the most recent release almost always matches the current state of the repo, so unless you want to make a PR, there's no need to clone the repo to run.
